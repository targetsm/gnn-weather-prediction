# DL Project

To run our code please download the dataset following the instructions provided on the [WeatherBench](https://github.com/pangeo-data/WeatherBench) github. We use only the 5.625deg version. The branches that start with hand_in_ are the final version of the respective model and you only need to pass the location of the dataset on your machine (make sure it is unzipped correctly) and the network will start training. If you run into memory issues please reduce the number of batches.
