# DL Project

To run our code please download the dataset following the instructions provided on the [WeatherBench](https://github.com/pangeo-data/WeatherBench) github. The Branches that start with handin_ are the final version of the respective model and you only need to pass the location of the dataset on your machine (make sure it is unzipped correctly).
